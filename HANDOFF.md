# HANDOFF.md: index

Session notes live in `docs/handoff/`. Each agent writes its own dated file (`YYYY-MM-DD-<agent>-<task>.md`), so notes never conflict. This file only holds the index and standing facts. Read the rules in `AGENTS.md` and the plain-language overview in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.

## Current state (keep short; update when it changes)

- **Codenames:** Claude (Opus 5.5) is **Ophelia**, the technical lead. Antigravity is **Ava**. Both are she/her.
- **Live:** https://atrium-workboards.web.app runs:
  - the shell, Home, My work and workspaces
  - the board table (P1b), subitems and the full item view
  - the item card and updates (VF5 fidelity pass, 2026-10-26)
  - saved views and the Kanban view (VF6 fidelity pass, 2026-10-26)
  - workspace membership, invites and member profiles (P4a, 2026-10-26)
  - thin monday-style scrollbars everywhere (VF7, 2026-10-26)
  - every registered column type has a web cell, including Files, Button, Time tracking, Formula, Dependency, Connect boards and Mirror
  - change a column's type, with undo (2026-10-31)
  - the Calendar and Timeline views (2026-10-31)
  - @mentions in updates, replies and descriptions
  - the Activity log (board and item), button actions with notify, column descriptions and defaults, reorderable favourites (2026-11-03)
  - archive, trash and undo
  - empty states and the notifications bell and panel (2026-10-30)
  - the layering fix for menus
- **Data:** Firestore named database **`atrium-1`** (`eur3`, scheduled backups), through `FIRESTORE_DATABASE_ID`. `(default)` (`nam5`) is unused legacy.
- **Showcase:** the "🧪 Atrium Showcase" board is in the owner's Test Workspace (id in `.private/project-ids.md`, gitignored, local only). Re-seed it per `docs/showcase.md`.
- **MCP connector:** a local MCP server lets Claude edit boards and items in the live Atrium (`docs/mcp-connector.md`, `pnpm mcp`).
- **Deploys:** automatic on merge to `main`. Eventarc and Cloud Scheduler are set up. **Merge only when the checks pass**; the repo has no branch protection (an owner decision).
- **Bugs:** the owner posts them in the monday Roadmap's 🐞 Bugs → "Bug inbox" item. Check it at the start of every session (`AGENTS.md`).
- **Actionable column** on the Roadmap: Yes (owner's move), Agents (owner answered, so it's back with us), No. Check the Agents items at the start of every session (`AGENTS.md`).
- **Folders:** `D:\DevProjects\Atrium\atrium-cl` (Ophelia, offset 0) and `atrium-ag` (Ava, offset 100). Avoid offset 30 (port 9180 is often taken).

## Open work (2026-11-04)

- **Live since 2026-11-03** (autonomous batch while the owner was away): the Activity web UI (#63), button actions (#65) and the notify action (#72), column settings (#66), reorder favourite boards (#68), and the rich-text backend (#69, `contentDoc` on updates and replies). Earlier: P4 notifications, board sharing, Calendar, Timeline and Chart views, Mirror, change a column's type, My Work, global search.
- **Open PR:** #74, rich text in the update composer and replies (web side of #69). Roadmap 3327934712 is Pending Merge. Review, run the checks and baselines if needed, then merge with rebase.
- **P5 automations:** the design is merged as a proposal (`docs/specs/P5-automations-design.md`, #73). Roadmap "Automation engine design" (3306251672) is Planning with Actionable = Yes. **Do not start P5a** until the owner answers the six questions in section 11.
- **Merged but local-only:** the Atrium MCP connector (OPS3, #60), not yet run against production.
- **Ava is on a break with no end date.** Ophelia works alone. Ava's Roadmap items are Agent = Claude.
- **Waiting on the owner:** the live checks in `docs/plans/owner-check-list.md` (Activity log, button actions, notify, column settings, favourites; notify needs two accounts), the P5 questions, whether "Required" columns need a hard rule, and the flag emoji on Windows (needs a CDN picture fallback). The legacy-activity migration script has not been run; dry run first and only with the owner's agreement.
- **Next, in this order:**
  1. Merge #74 once it is reviewed, then move 3327934712 to In review and add its owner check.
  2. Flaky test: world clock tests in `packages/shared` (Roadmap 3328651015).
  3. Remaining Roadmap items that need no product decision. Anything that does goes on the item with Actionable = Yes and an exact question.
  4. Check the bug inbox and Actionable = Agents first (filter by label id, Agents = 4, not the index).
- Plan and gotchas: `docs/plans/2026-11-03-autonomous-batch.md` and `docs/handoff/2026-11-03-ophelia-autonomous-batch.md`.
